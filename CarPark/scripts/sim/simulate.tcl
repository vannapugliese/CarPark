# **NOTE
#
# There is no "non-project mode" simulation Tcl flow in Vivado, the "non-project mode" flow
# requires to call standalone xvlog/xvhdl, xelab and xsim executables from the command-line
# or inside a GNU Makefile.
# However in "non-project mode" the simulation can't be re-invoked from the GUI after RTL
# or testbench changes, thus requiring to exit from the GUI and re-build the simulation
# from scratch. This happens because XSim doesn't keep track of xvlog/xvhdl and xelab flows.
#
# In order to be able to "relaunch" a simulation from the XSim GUI you necessarily have to
# create a project in Vivado or to use a "project mode" Tcl script to automate the simulation.
# The overhead of creating an in-memory project is low compared to the benefits of fully automated
# one-step compilation/elaboration/simulation and re-launch features.
#
# This **CUSTOM** Tcl-based simulation flow basically reproduces all compilation/elaboration/simulation
# steps that actually Vivado performs "under the hood" for you without notice in project-mode.
# Most important, this custom flow is **PORTABLE** across Linux/Windows systems and allows
# to "relaunch" a simulation after RTL or testbench changes from the XSim Tcl console without
# the need of creating a project.
